## 01.04.2016 ##
Protocol changes:
- Agar changed auth packet, check [issue #129](https://github.com/pulviscriptor/agario-client/issues/129)

Code changes due to [PR #130](https://github.com/pulviscriptor/agario-client/pull/130)
- `client.auth_provider` is not used anymore
- Google+ tokens support is unknown at the moment

## 21.03.2016 ##
- Event `client.on.getLogin` added

## 19.03.2016 ##
Code changes:
- Event `client.on.leaderBoardUpdate` arguments changed from 
 `old_leaders_ids, new_leaders_ids` 
 to 
 `old_highlights, new_highlights, old_names, new_names` 
 as fix for changed packet ID 49 (fixed by [kosak](https://github.com/kosak))

## 18.03.2016 ##
Protocol changes:
- Initial key (pakect ID 255) changed key from 2200049715 to 154669603

## 17.03.2016 ##
Protocol changes:
- New packet ID `104` that forces client to call `window.logout()` to logout from account

Code changes:
- New event `client.on.logoutRequest` for logout packet ID `104`

## 28.02.2016 ##
Protocol changes:
- New packet ID `18` that commands to delete all known balls from memory.

Code changes:

## 16.02.2016 ##
Now agar.io sends random "virtual" size map as protection from bots.
New sizes are refreshing in `client.on.mapSizeLoad` event.
When you re-spawning you should delete old balls from memory because their coordinates will be invalid. Not adding this to client's code because it can be changed by agar any time.

## 28.01.2016 ##
Now agar.io server allows only 3 connections from single IP instead of 5.

## 14.01.2016 ##
Added support for the debug line (added by [henopied](https://github.com/henopied))
Code changes:

## 13.01.2016 ##
Code changes:
- `client.local_address` added. Local interface to bind to for network connections (IP address of interface)
- `AgarioClient.servers` `opt.local_address` added. Local interface to bind to for network connections (IP address of interface)

## 07.01.2016 ##
Code changes:
- `client.on.packetError(packet, err, preventCrash)` added. Check [issue #46](https://github.com/pulviscriptor/agario-client/issues/46#issuecomment-169764771)
